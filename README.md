# My Study Notes

This repository was created to store some of my notes when studying computer science. 

### Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

This folder was created in September 2017 when I was studying data structures and Java programming language. It is based on the book *[Data Structures and Algorithms in Java 6th Edition]*(Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms%20in%20Java/Related_Materials/Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms%20in%20Java%206th%20Edition.2014.pdf). I put some samples and most of the exercises to this folder.
