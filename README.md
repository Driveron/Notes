# My Study Notes

This repository was created to store some of my notes when studying computer science. 

### Data Structures and Algorithms in Java

This folder was created in September 2017 when I was studying data structures and Java programming language. It is based on the book [Data Structures and Algorithms in Java 6th Edition](Data\ Structures\ and\ Algorithms\ in\ Java/Related_Materials/Data\ Structures\ and\ Algorithms\ in\ Java\ 6th\ Edition.2014.pdf). I put some samples and most of the exercises to this folder.
